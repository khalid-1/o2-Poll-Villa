Subject: Build a React Website for "O2 Pool Villa" based on provided prototype code.

Context:
I have a luxury private pool villa business called "O2 Pool Villa" (O2 referring to Oxygen/Water). We have two villas: "Villa Oxygen" and "Villa Ozone". I need a website that functions similarly to Airbnb, allowing users to view photos, amenities, and check availability.

Technical Requirements:

Framework: React.js (Create React App or Vite).

Styling: Tailwind CSS (Must be configured to support the provided classes).

Icons: lucide-react library.

Current State: I have a complete, single-file React prototype (attached/pasted below) that handles the UI, routing (via tabs), and responsive design.

Key Features to Implement:

Availability Calendar: The current code uses a mock array MOCK_BOOKED_DATES. I need this to eventually connect to Booking.com and Airbnb via iCal. For now, ensure the UI accurately renders these blocked dates.

Responsive Design: The site must look perfect on mobile (hamburger menu) and desktop (sticky header).

Visual Theme: The design uses a "Cyan/Blue" color palette to represent Oxygen and Water.

Your Task:
Please take the React code provided below and set up a functional project structure for it.

Initialize the project.

Install lucide-react and configure Tailwind CSS.

Place the code into the main App component.

Ensure the "Book Now" and contact forms are rendered correctly.
